A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/tsuhre/pen/xgmEPe](https://codepen.io/tsuhre/pen/xgmEPe).

A small P5 program to generate random circuit board like designs. The wires ended up being a lot more disorganized than I really wanted them to be, so I'll need to think of a way to have them sort of form to each other to solve the space-filling issue.
